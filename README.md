# Snake Game

This is a simple and fun Snake game implemented in Java, using a grid-based design to handle the game logic and UI elements. Players can control the snake using the arrow keys to move it around the grid, eating food to grow in size and gain points.

## Features

- Single-player and two-player modes
- Classic snake movement and growth
- Food and SuperFood items for the snake to eat
- Adjustable game speed
- Pause and restart functionality
- Game over detection and score tracking
- High score tracking and display

## How to Play

1. Compile and run the game.
2. Choose between single-player or two-player mode.
3. Control the snake(s) using the arrow keys (for player 1) and W, A, S, D keys (for player 2, if applicable).
4. Eat food and SuperFood items to grow the snake(s) and increase the score. SuperFood items provide double points and have a limited lifespan.
5. Avoid colliding with the grid boundaries and the snake's own body.
6. Press Spacebar to pause or resume the game.
7. When the game is over, press Enter to restart.
